There are many protocols for emails and HTTP.

Hi Sales team,

We will be sending out password reset links in the upcoming week so that we can get you registered on the ERP system.

Regards,
IT

Sales team password is sales and it has a message from it team.  
From the looks of it, this can be used for phishing.

I sent an email to Brian, while disguised as IT team with the malicious URL.
And I got the response from him.

# Decoded URL

I got his credentials.

From the information above, this default script is run every time disclaimer user gets email. So I added the reverse shell in the script.

# Note

Participating in this CTF was quite a challenge, as it required the creativity to formulate a phishing strategy. I am not sure if its practical for OSCP prep but at least I learned how to enumerate email protocol, I guess.

Anyway, happy hacking!
